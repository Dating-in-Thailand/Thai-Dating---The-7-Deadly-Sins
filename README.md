If (when) you're heading over to Thailand, the chances are high you'll want a bit of Thai dating going, right?

## The 1st Deadly Sin

I've met a great many Thai girls on dating sites. Many of these sites are filled with gold-diggers, whores, and ladyboys (who pretend to be women).

Finding a genuine Thai girlfriend is fraught with dangers on many of these sites. Try out ThaiRomances if you want a better experience.

So Thai girls pretending to be something that they're not is the first deadly sin when it comes to Thai dating.

You must find out what their agenda is. It's OK if you want a holiday girlfriend, just a new friend to chat with, a ladyboy, a freelancer, or a love and relationship.

Set your goal and get who YOU want - not the other way around.

## Second Sin of Thai Dating

Big boobs aren't everything.

Females in Thailand know "how to swing it". Every Thai woman knows the ways of men. They know boobs, makeup, a sexy ass, and alluring looks are the bait to hook a man into their sweet arms.

But it's important you take things calmly. There is an enormous number of Thai girls who are waiting in the wings. And those girls are also equally as inviting for your attention.

Decide your own agenda and the various categories you want in a woman. When you're online and see a female Thai dating as well, ask yourself the question of whether she ticks all your boxes.

Areas to consider would include body shape, skin tone, hair length, her location [in Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand), the girl's English language skills, and (after some chatting) her sexual outlook.

Those are important areas that you may or may not care about.

## Deadly Sin #3

Thai dating websites are easy to use and a lot of fun. Where else in real life do you get the opportunity to see and chat with thousands of sexy young Asian women?

But you aren't their savoir when it comes to their life's troubles.

It is easy to become involved in their woes. They speak sweet gentle words. Their looks sometimes overwhelm you to the point of an online relationship (which it isn't).

But remember your purpose is to find your special lady (or ladyboy) who will make you happy in life.

You are not a Thai girls' overseas bank account. Everyone has financial troubles. Women often think they can illicit money from men by sweet words.

Don't fall for this trap and keep your money safe. At least until you know the girls well enough.

## What the 4th?

It's about messaging online and not messaging online.

You've already picked up on the fact many Thai girls who are online want to find themselves an easy guy who will do anything. And that's an OK agenda to have.

We all want an easy-going person, right?

Thai girls will often push to move to a dedicated messaging app like LINE. But Thai dating is about finding who YOU want.

You are best to keep chatting inside your Thai dating app with many women. You must be chatting online to several women. Your purpose is to weed out the wrong ones to find the right one.

Keep chatting online until YOU determine whether you have found some good ones.

Keep rating and scoring the girls (or ladyboys) inside the app. Tell the girls you aren't ready to chat outside. If they don't like it then that Thai girl is not the one for you.

If she is really interested then she'll follow your lead - that's who you want.

## The Number 5 Sin

**The Farang Syndrome**

Farang (Thai: ฝรั่ง, [faràŋ], colloquially [falàŋ]) is a Thai word for a person of a white race no matter their country of origin.

"Who she hangs out with the most will have a more significant impact on her attitudes and conduct".

This one is for guys not looking for a Thai girlfriend or a Thai freelancer lol

The majority of overseas foreigners who are new to Thai dating simply want to meet a sweet, wholesome Thai woman who is devoid of previous experiences with sex tourists.

Why is knowing foreigners such a big deal for you?

**Answer: Bad habits and behavior.**

When a girl associates with a particular demographic for long enough then her behavior changes to that associated with these men. Thai women, for example, who live in and around the Nana and Sukhumvit areas in Bangkok are well versed in the ways of foreign sex tourists and the Thai freelancers in these areas.

They develop habits and attitudes far removed from the sweet, sexy, slim, and wholesome "Thai wife material' that you probably are seeking.

## No. 6 Is a Stunner!

The words "Take Care Me"

Those words hold much meaning in different ways and will be the most confusing when you first read them in your initial Thai dating experience, trust me.

"Take Care Me" can mean any of the following:-

- I want a good guy who loves me forever
- I need money to help my situation
- Can you pay my rent?
- I'm a Sex Freelancer and do you want some regular action?

The gold-digger Thai girl demands significant upkeep and extravagance.

A normal girl in Thailand is content with you propping up her meagre salary by buying simple food or inexpensive clothes. That's reasonable conduct in Thailand.

Bad girls ramp the practice up, beyond belief.

## 7 Is The Charm

Understanding the woman from her dating profile photos is wise.

You can tell an awful lot from a Thai girl's photos.

- A good Thai woman is traditional in nature and personality.
- A good Thai girl will not have tattoos or if she does tattoos will be few, minimal, and hidden from public view. They can be sexy too.
- Makeup that is subtle and sexy is a sign of a demure girl. Outlandish is a sign of a sex worker vying for attention and customers.
- Are her photos racy or plain and subtle?
